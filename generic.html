								<h2><br>What motivates me in technical studies?</br></h2>
								<p>I was interesting technical field when I was young, because when computer ran into some errors or something problem with devices, 
									I tried to fix by self. I don’t remember what the error message was. But keyboard and mouse were not working, that times I tried to 
									disassemble the computer, keyboard, or mouse. I stayed there until I fixed it. I was happy after fix device. 
									However, I immigrated to the US, I was having more knowledge to medical field, and most of friends are nurses, so I was studied nursing, 
									but I did not success to be a nurse. </p>
								<p>During COVID 19, I had time to think about what I like and what I am good at. I wrote so many different majors what I was interested, 
									and then search those majors. That time I remember when I was young. I liked to fix some problem with computer, so I asked to my 
									brother about computer science because he is studying computer science. He gave me some information about what computer science is. 
									We talked a lot about computer science. I thought very carefully choose major because I am not young, and I do not want to fail again. 
									I applied Queen’s College. I took the Intro to Algorithmic Problem Solving course. That time I learn C++ language, and my first time 
									to print program word was “Hello World”. That time it was amazing and interesting. I want to learn more about computer language and 
									make a program.  </p>
